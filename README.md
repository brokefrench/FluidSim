## FluidSim
A basic fluid simulation program written in C++ using the SFML Library. This simulation is a C++ port of [Mike Ash's simulation paper](https://www.mikeash.com/pyblog/fluid-simulation-for-dummies.html).

This project was written with the goal to put my programming skills to the test, but also to get myself used to git commands and various NVIM motions.


# Basic commands
```
make clean
make build 
make run 
make memory
```
